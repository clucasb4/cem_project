# cem_project
Deep dive into Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) using Python and the LeLonde (modified LaLonde) dataset from the R CEM package.

# Resources for CEM:
2008 Article on the CEM algorithm: https://gking.harvard.edu/files/cem.pdf
LaLonde dataset(s): https://users.nber.org/~rdehejia/data/.nswdata2.html
Note: For the R CEM Package (also MatchIt), a modified version of the LaLonde dataset is used and intentionally mispelled as 'LeLonde'.
